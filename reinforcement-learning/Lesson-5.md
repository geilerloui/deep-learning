# Lesson 5: Monte carlo methods

## 1. Introduction

This lesson covers material in **Chapter 5** (especially 5.1-5.6) of the textbook.

## 2. MC prediction: state values

In this lesson we will confine our attention to episodic tasks where the interaction stops at some time step $T$ when the agent encounters a terminal state and we refer to the sequence **as an episode**
$$
S_0, A_0, R_1, A_1, R_2, ..., S_T
$$
The agent goal is to find $\pi$ that maximize:
$$
\mathbb{E}_{\pi} \Big[ \sum_{t=1}^{T} R_t \Big]
$$

To reduce some complexity we will use the **On-Policy Method** instead for the moment.

<img src="images/5-2_RL.png" style="height:100px">

For motivation we will see an example, a very small frozen world, if the agent lands at the state $Z$ the episode end. The world will be slippery, if the agent choose the action down, there are some positive probability to go up or stay where it is. 
Say we would like to evaluate the policy or going up or down

We can calculate the value-function:

As we can see for $Y$ the situation might be a bit more complicated, actually we will define two types of algorithm: - First-visit MC method:

<img src="images/5-6_RL.png" style="height:200px">

And the second one: **every-visit MC method**

<img src="images/5-7_RL.png" style="height:200px">

## 3. MC prediction: action values

Our next step in the Dynamic Programming setting was to convert $v_{\pi}$ to $q_{\pi}$, as a recall we used the following equation:
$$
q_{\pi}(s,a) = \sum_{s' \in \mathcal{S}, ~r \in \mathcal{R}} p(s',r \mid s,a) (r + \gamma v_{\pi}(s'))
$$
Unfortunately **we won't be able to use this formula**, we use to know the one-step dynamic $p(s',r\mid s,a)$ which was known to the agent but in the RL setting the agent doesn't know this setting. 

Instead of looking at each state, we will look at each (state, value) pair and average them as before after doing the calculation.

<img src="images/5-8_RL.png" style="height:200px">

We do the same for Y, with the **first-visit MC method** or **every-visit MC method**, anyway with more episodes they should converge to the same value.

<img src="images/5-9_RL.png" style="height:200px">

One of the problem we have, is that we are actually following a deterministic policy, as we can see when in the state $X$ we only have one possible action, so it won't be possible to calculate the $???$ value on the bottom right.

One of the solution is to not consider a deterministic policy

## 4. generalized policy iteration

Now that we have seen the **Prediction Problem** we will focus on the **Control Problem**

<img src="images/5-12_RL.png" style="height:200px">

We have seen three general algorithms in the previous setting :

<img src="images/5-13_RL.png" style="height:250px">

Even if those algorithms are different it will be useful to find what they have in common, and we will use the term **Generalized Policy Iteration** to refer to this general process

<img src="images/5-14_RL.png" style="height:200px">

Our Monte Carlo control algorithm will draw inspiration from generalised policy iteration. We'll begin with the policy evaluation step. We've already somewhat adressed how to accomplish this, in the blacjack game, the agent needs to play blackjack about 5,000 times to get a good estimate of the value function. 

In the context of policy iteration, this seems like way too long to spend evaluating a policy before trying to improve it. Maybe it would make more sense to improve the policy after every individual game of blackjack. 

We could start by initialising the value of each state action pair to zero and some starting policy to generate an episode. 

<img src="images/5-15_RL.png" style="height:200px">

Recall that when we calculated $v_{\pi}$, we calculcated the return for each episode, and then we took the average, we will denote $x_i$ all of those returns our value function estimate will be denoted by:

<img src="images/5-16_RL.png" style="height:200px"> 

So instead of calculating at the end of the episode, we will update the estimate of the value function this way:

<img src="images/5-17_RL.png" style="height:225px">

## 5. mc control: policy evaluation

What we have just seen can only estimate a **single action-value pair**, we need to generalise this idea.

#### Policy Evaluation (the green part)

----

We could start by initialising the value of each state action pair to zero, denoted $Q(s,a)$. $N(S_t, A_t)$ is used in accordance with the update of the mean we just saw, it is the number of time we visited each pair

<img src="images/5-18_RL.png" style="height:225px">



#### Policy Improvement (the blue part)

----

So given an action-value function, how may we use it to propose a policy. Is it possible to just copy the algorithm from the dynamic programming case ?
$$
\pi(s) \leftarrow \underset{a \in \mathcal{A}(s)}{arg~max~} Q(s, a) ~~\forall s \in S
$$
In other words, for each state we just pick the action with the highest value. Actually it is kind of a valid approach here, we'll just need to do some amendments. To see this let's look at an example:

**Example:**

---

Let's say the agent starts opening Door B, he gets a rewards of 0, then Door A, he gets a reward of 1, by using a greedy approach he still keeps opening Door A, he gets 3, 1 and so on â€¦ And never open the Door B because of the first value he got. This is not a good approach, if the agent opened the Door B a second time he could have gotten a 100 reward.

<img src="images/5-19_RL.png" style="height:225px">

So instead of always doing a greedy policy, we will construct stochastic policy, where we will very often take the greedy policy, but with a very small probability we will choose the second one, a non greedy action. We will set a $\varepsilon$ value

<img src="images/5-21_RL.png" style="height:225px">

We can finally adjust the algorithm:
