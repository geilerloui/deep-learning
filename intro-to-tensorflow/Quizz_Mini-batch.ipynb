    "### Mini-batching\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll go over what mini-batching is and how to apply it in TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mini-batching is a technique for training on subsets of the dataset instead of all the data at one time. This provides the ability to train a model, even if a computer lacks the memory to store the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mini-batching is computationally inefficient, since you can't calculate the loss simultaneously across all samples. However, this is a small price to pay in order to be able to run the model at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also quite useful combined with SGD. The idea is to randomly shuffle the data at the start of each epoch, then create the mini-batches. For each mini-batch, you train the network weights with gradient descent. Since these batches are random, you're performing SGD with each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the MNIST dataset with weights and a bias to see if your machine can handle it."
